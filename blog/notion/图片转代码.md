# screenshot-to-code

This simple app converts a screenshot to HTML/Tailwind CSS. It uses GPT-4 Vision to generate the code and DALL-E 3 to generate similar-looking images.

## 🛠 Getting Started

<!-- truncate -->

The app has a React/Vite frontend and a FastAPI backend. You will need an OpenAI API key with access to the GPT-4 Vision API. 
Run the backend (I use Poetry for package management -  pip install poetry  if you don't have it): 
```plain text
cd backend
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key" > .env
poetry install
poetry shell
poetry run uvicorn main:app --reload --port 7001
```
Run the frontend: 
```plain text
cd frontend
yarn
yarn dev
```
Open  http://localhost:5173  to use the app. 
If you prefer to run the backend on a different port, update VITE_WS_BACKEND_URL in  frontend/.env.local 
## Docker

<!-- truncate -->

If you have Docker installed on your system, in the root directory, run: 
```plain text
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key" > .env
docker-compose up -d --build
```
The app will be up and running at  http://localhost:5173 . Note that you can't develop the application with this setup as the file changes won't trigger a rebuild.
